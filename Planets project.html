                    The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit<br>
                    it, either directly or indirectly.Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the<br>
                    planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit<br>
                    the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.
                    <br>

                       
            <br>

            The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular<br>
            cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of 
            the remaining mass contained
            in Jupiter<br>. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily<br>
            composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the<br>
            terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and heliu;<br>
            the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with<br>
            relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia<br>
            and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and<br>
            Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit<br>
             lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices,<br>
            and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations are several dozen to<br>
            possibly tens of thousands of objects large enough that they have been rounded by their own gravity. Such<br>
            objects are categorized as dwarf planets. Identified dwarf planets include the asteroid Ceres and the trans<br>
            -Neptunian objects Pluto and Eris. In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations,<br>
             including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets,<br>
             at least four of the dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, usually termed<br>
            "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.
