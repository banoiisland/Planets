                                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has the longest rotation period<br>
                                     (243 days) of any planet in the Solar System and rotates in the opposite<br>
                                     direction to most other planets (meaning the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east). It does not<br>
                                     have any natural satellites. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It is the second-brightest natural<br>
                                      object in the night sky after the Moon, reaching an apparent<br>
                                     magnitude of −4.6 – bright enough to cast shadows at night and, rarely, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight<br>
                                     . Orbiting within Earth's orbit, Venus is an inferior planet<br>
                                      and never appears to venture far from the Sun; its maximum angular distance from the Sun (elongation) is 47.8°.

                                    As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the morning star and evening star. Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BC.[20]
